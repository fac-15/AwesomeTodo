# 🗂 Team Awesome's To Do App

Our attempt at building a to do web app using Test Driven Development.

## 🙌 Getting Started

It's a website! So with some luck 🤞 you should be able to access it at [this link!](https://fac-15.github.io/AwesomeTodo/)

## 💾 Installation

If you would like to clone and download the files to see locally, you can use the github clone or download button above.
If so, please be sure to run `npm install` in order to download our dev dependencies.

## ✅ Running the tests

Once [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) is installed, tests can be run with `npm test`

## 👷‍ Built with

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) for testing
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- [Basic app skeleton from FAC](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook/week-2/project)

## 🏋️‍ Our process

- Installing Jest
- Read through skeleton together
- Test that Jest actually works and connects to the right files
- Work on logic.js functions
- Work on the DOM
- Basic styling

## 🕷 Known issues and bugs 🐛

- Not particularly responsive for mobile or different sized screens
- Mark as done button doesn't function properly

## 🧘‍Stretch goals
- Literally finishing 😂
- Adding a function for sorting to dos
- Styling mobile first from the start
- Adding error message when attempting to press submit with an empty text field

## 📚 What we struggled with/what we learned 👾
- Using ! to toggle
  - `    elementDone.done = !elementDone.done;`
- toBe vs toEqual in Jest, particularly in reference to arrays
- Using describe() in testing to create sections of tests
- Struggle with the DOM
- Forgetting return statements in testing
- Complexity of tests vs functions
